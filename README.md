**ABSTRACT**<br>
The COVID-19 pandemic has started and created unexpected challenges in different aspects globally. This has also resulted in an educational crisis in which online classes are forced to be implemented to help students learn even without direct interaction. This study aims to analyze the online education sentiments of students, teachers, as well as other stakeholders in the Philippines from the tweets collected from Twitter within the time period of the start of the implementation of online classes  from March 2020 to December 2022, using the Naïve Bayes Algorithm to produce sentiment analysis results. In the findings of the Analysis, there are 64.1 percent neutral sentiment in the tweets, 20.3 percent positive sentiment, and 15.7 percent for the negative sentiment. The Naive Bayes Algorithm has an 86.2 % accuracy of analyzing sentiments from tweets. Twitter users are more likely to be neutral towards online class during the pandemic overall but a little more dissatisfied than satisfied with how the online class works as the results show.
